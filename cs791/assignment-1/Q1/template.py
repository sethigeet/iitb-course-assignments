        data : dict
            The input data containing the graphical model details, such as variables, cliques, potentials, and k value.

        ----------------
        - Parse the input data and store necessary attributes (e.g., variables, cliques, potentials, k value).
        - Initialize any data structures required for triangulation, junction tree creation, and message passing.
        
        Refer to the sample test case for the structure of the input data.
